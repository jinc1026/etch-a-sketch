Etch-A-Sketch

By applying basic front-end development skills (layout using grid & flexbox and DOM manipulation), 
I created a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

The grid and size of sketch board can be adjusted dymamically and it changes the color of each block based on mouse-hover event.
